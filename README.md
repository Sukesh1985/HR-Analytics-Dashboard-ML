## üìä DAX Measures (Sample)

### Key Performance Indicators
```dax
Total Employees = COUNTROWS(HR_Analytics)

Attrition Rate = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(HR_Analytics), HR_Analytics[Attrition] = "Yes"),
    COUNTROWS(HR_Analytics),
    0
)

High Risk Employees = 
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(HR_Analytics),
    HR_Analytics[OverTime] = "Yes",
    HR_Analytics[JobSatisfaction] <= 2,
    HR_Analytics[WorkLifeBalance] <= 2
)

Avg Monthly Income = AVERAGE(HR_Analytics[MonthlyIncome])
```
